# Predicting Cyberbullying on Social Media using Machine Learning Techniques

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict instances of cyberbullying on social media platforms. The goal is to create a system that identifies harmful behavior and contributes to a safer online environment.

## Key Components

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: 
   - Gathered a dataset of social media posts and comments, including both bullying and non-bullying instances.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure quality and relevance.

2. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Extracted meaningful features from the text data, such as sentiment scores, word frequency, and linguistic patterns, to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

3. **Model Development**: 
   - Experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, to determine the most effective approach for classification.

4. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring effective identification of cyberbullying while minimizing false positives.

5. **Insights and Recommendations**: 
   - Provided valuable insights into the patterns of cyberbullying behavior, informing strategies for prevention and intervention on social media platforms.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- NLTK or SpaCy (for natural language processing)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Monieshkumar54/Predicting-Cyberbullying-on-Social-Media-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques.git

## Results

The model achieved the following performance metrics:

- Accuracy: 0.9080568223515227
- Precision: 0.9277217559326127
- Recall: 0.9650147603793732
- F1-Score: 0.9460008620158857
  
These metrics indicate the model's effectiveness in identifying instances of cyberbullying.

## Conclusion

This project not only strengthened my technical skills in machine learning and data analysis but also deepened my understanding of the social implications of technology. I am passionate about leveraging data science to address real-world challenges, and this experience has further fueled my interest in the intersection of technology and social responsibility.
